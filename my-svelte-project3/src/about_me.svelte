    In the 11th grade, I took part in a hackathon, where I made up pages for the project (we won there by the way)<br><br>
    Well, then, by the will of fate, I was brought to Innopolis.For a whole year I've been thinking about what kind of programmer I want to be and now I realized that I'm very interested in developing websites and thinking through the interface!</p>
